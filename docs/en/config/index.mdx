# Overview

The configuration file for `electron-rsbuild` is `electron.rsbuild.config.ts`, with the following example configuration:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'electron-rsbuild';
import { pluginReact } from '@rsbuild/plugin-react';
export default defineConfig({
  environments: {
    // main process
    main: {},
    //preload
    preload: {},
    //renderer process
    renderer: {
      // Must be installed for React projects, otherwise it won't start
      plugins: [pluginReact()],
    },
  },
});
```

Special note: The `rsbuild` plugin @rsbuild/plugin-react in React projects needs to be manually installed. To avoid interfering with rsbuild configuration, it is not provided here.

For configuration items, please refer to the relevant [config section](https://rsbuild.dev/zh/config/index) of `rsbuild`.
